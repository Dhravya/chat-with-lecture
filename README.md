![Chat with your Lecture](https://i.dhr.wtf/r/Image_from_Slack.png)

## Why?

As a university student it's very annoying to interrupt the lecture to ask a question. And if the question is not good, it ends up disturbing the whole class and embarrassing for the student. This is why I made this project. It allows students to ask questions in real time without interrupting the lecture. Also provides a live transcript of the lecture so that nothing is missed. This tool can later be used to generate notes and study material.

### Features

- Ask questions about your lecture in real time
- Get your doubts solved without interrupting your lecture
- Get a live transcript of your lecture

### Installation

First, get the environment variables from the `.env.example` file and create a `.env` file with the same variables. Then, run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/dhravya/chat-with-lecture.git
bun install
```

### Usage
```
bun run dev
```

### Contributing

This is not a complete project, just a technical demonstration of what [Embedchain](https://embedchain.ai) can do, and how easily it can be integrated into your project.
